1. **Folders**:

   - Always use **lowercase** letters with **underscores** for folder names (e.g., `assets/`, `player/`).
   - Avoid spaces and special characters.

2. **Files**:

   - stick to **snake_case** (e.g., `stage1.py`, `player.py`, `player_healt.py`).

3. **Classes**:
   - Use **CamelCase** for class names (e.g., `Stage1`, `Player`).
